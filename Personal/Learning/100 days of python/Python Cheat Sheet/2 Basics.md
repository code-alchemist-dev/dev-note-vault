## Print
Prints a string to the console.
```python
print("Hello World")
```

## Input
Prints a string to the console and prompts the user for input.
```python
input("What's your name?")
```

## Comments
Adding a `#` symbol in front of text allows you to make comments on a line of code. The computer will ignore your comments.
```python
# This is a comment
print("This is code")
```

## Variables
A variable assigns a name to a piece of data. Like a labeled box, it indicates what is inside the box.
```python
my_name = "Angela"
my_age = 12
```

## The `+=` Operator
This operator is a convenient way to say, "take the previous value and add to it."
```python
my_age = 12
my_age += 4
# my_age is now 16
```

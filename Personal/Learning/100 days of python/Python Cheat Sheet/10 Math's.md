## Arithmetic Operators
You can perform mathematical calculations in Python using the following operators.
```python
3 + 2  # Add
4 - 1  # Subtract
2 * 3  # Multiply
5 / 2  # Divide
5 ** 2  # Exponent
```

## The `+=` Operator
This operator allows you to modify a variable by adding to its existing value. You can also use other mathematical operators such as `-=`, `*=`.
```python
my_number = 4
my_number += 2
# result is 6
```

## The Modulo Operator
The modulo operator gives you the remainder after a division. It is useful in certain situations, such as determining if a number is odd or even.
```python
5 % 2
# result is 1
```

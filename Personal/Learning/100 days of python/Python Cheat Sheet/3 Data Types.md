## Integers
Integers are whole numbers.
```python
my_number = 354
```

## Strings
A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.
```python
my_string = "Hello"
```

## String Concatenation
You can add strings together to create a new string. This process is called concatenation.
```python
"Hello" + "Angela"
# becomes "HelloAngela"
```

## Escaping a String
To include a double quote within a string, escape it with a backslash `\`.
```python
speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
print(speech)
# prints: She said: "Hi"
```

## F-Strings
You can insert a variable into a string using f-strings. Simply insert the variable between curly braces `{}`.
```python
days = 365
print(f"There are {days} days in a year")
```

## Converting Data Types
You can convert a variable from one data type to another.
Converting to float: `float()`
Converting to int: `int()`
Converting to string: `str()`
```python
n = 354
new_n = float(n)
print(new_n) # result 354.0
```

## Checking Data Types
You can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a particular variable.
```python
n = 3.14159
type(n) # result float
```

## Floating Point Numbers
Floats are numbers with decimal places. When you perform a calculation that results in a fraction (e.g., 4 รท 3), the result will always be a floating point number.
```python
my_float = 3.14159
```
